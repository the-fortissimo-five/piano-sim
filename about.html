          <p>Jeff Lawrence: Throughout my life I have always enjoyed learning and exploring new technologies as they entered the marketplace.  In recent years I have become very interested in software development.  I really enjoy solving problems and learning new concepts, both of which are an everyday occurrence when programming.  Until now, I never had the opportunity to transition careers and actually work in the field and I couldn't be more excited.</p>
