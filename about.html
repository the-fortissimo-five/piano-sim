        <p>Chloie Parsons: I am a creative soul inhabiting an analytical brain. I love being outdoors and helping people achieve their dreams, especially their online presence. If it is sunny, you will find me on the lake, but snow will keep me by the fire. I have been to four countries and 50 states. My favorite color is orange and I have both a dog and a cat.<a href="https://github.com/ChloieP"><img class="octocat" src="./assets/img/octocat.png"></a></p>

        <p>Jeff Lawrence: Throughout my life I have always enjoyed learning and exploring new technologies as they entered the marketplace.  In recent years I have become very interested in software development.  I really enjoy solving problems and learning new concepts, both of which are an everyday occurrence when programming.  Until now, I never had the opportunity to transition careers and actually work in the field and I couldn't be more excited.<a href="https://github.com/JeffLawrence1"><img class="octocat" src="./assets/img/octocat.png"></a></p>
