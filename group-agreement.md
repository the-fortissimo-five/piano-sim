We, the members of the fortissimo five, agree to the following:

General Principles: 
Practice the golden rule and remember that this is a team effort.
Consider scope carefully.
Stick to familiar techniques where possible.
The functionality of our project should be immediately obvious to fresh eyes.
Keep it simple.
Maintain humor.

  Expectations: Members will be present each day and give their best effort.
  Members will seek help when encountering issues they can't quickly resolve (within 10-15 minutes) on their own. 
  Members have the option to work outside of class hours, but aren't expected to unless the group revises these expectations.
  At the end of each day Members will meet to discuss their progress and any necessary revisions to our expected work hours. These decisions will be made by group vote where the simple majority wins. Exceptions made be made in case of exceptional circumstances.

Conflict Plan: When conflict is encountered...
1. Discuss the difference of ideas and try to settle the issue as individuals.
2. Take some time and space to reflect and consider the issue if necessary.
3. Bring in the whole group to the discussion if a resolution cannot be reached.
4. Escalate to instructors as an absolute last resort and last conduct.

Communication Plan: How to communicate... 
  How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
    Using slack private message for group
    Use phone numbers as a backup or in case of emergency.

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard?
  Ask questions: this benefits the individual and the group.
  Keep an eye out on each other.

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  Empathetically consider eachother.
  Give gentle feedback.
  Welcome the feedback.

When we will make the decision to have to work outside of regular hours?
